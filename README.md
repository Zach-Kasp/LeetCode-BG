# LeetCode-BG
LeetCode Beginner's Guide Challenge Problems in C#

1st commit. Date: July 19th
Progress includes 1st half of problems (Running Sum, Richest Customer, FizzBuzz)

2nd commit. Date: July 20th
Fixed a mistake for Richest Customer.

3rd commit. Date: July 20th.
Added 4th problem from LeetCode Beginner's guide (Steps to reduce)

Notes: Was using the BG as a tool to re-introduce myself to coding. After completing half of the assisgnments I feel I have gotten what I wanted out of the BG.

I think I will be moving on from the BG. Ideally, I would come back and clean up the rough code and add in comments.
